I am presently in my third year of studying Software Engineering at the Adventist University of Plata "UAP" in Argentina. Additionally, I have completed IBM courses with honors in both Data Analyst and Data Science. My work revolves around the intersection of fundamental statistics and programming, with a primary focus on Python

- Strong Habilities: Proficient in Python, I possess comprehensive skills in data cleaning and wrangling, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Additionally, I am proficient in SQL and adept at creating diverse diagrams for modeling and constructing databases from the ground up.

- Tools I use:
   * Basics: Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio, Python, SQL, AI.
   * Visualization: Tableau, Power Point, Matplotlib, Illustrator, Canvas, Plotly, Excel.
   * Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Seaborn.
    
- I am currently studying advanced statistics, machine learning and practice different python libraries
  
- Programming languages that I know from more to less: Python, SQL, Java, Kotlin, C#, JS, HTML, CSS.
  
- Regarding my academic background, I completed high school in 2016 and pursued a degree in industrial design at FADU UNL until 2020. In 2022, I commenced my studies in software engineering at UAP.

- Other things outside of programming: I studied industrial design for 3 years and worked full time in 2021 and continued doing some projects while studying engineering. I invest in the financial market since 2020 doing technical analysis, once I finish studying machine learning in depth I am going to start applying it to do algorithmic trading.
  
- About me: I reside in a small city in Entre RÃ­os, Argentina. In my leisure time, I enjoy spending quality moments with my family and friends. As hobbies, I engage in playing football, working out at the gym, and exploring subjects related to economics, history, and financial markets.
