Highly analytical Quantitative Developer & Data Scientist specializing in the intersection of Systems Engineering and Financial Risk Management (FRM). Currently in my 4th year of Systems Engineering, I combine a rigorous mathematical foundation with the ability to deploy scalable financial software, student github: https://github.com/LucasAlvarezr


My background includes 4+ years of hands-on experience in Argentine and US markets, managing proprietary capital through algorithmic bots and derivatives strategies. This dual perspective ensures a deep understanding of market microstructure, quantitative execution, and risk control.

I am proficient in the full Data Science lifecycle, from building high-performance ETL pipelines (APIs, Scraping) to advanced Feature Engineering and Model Validation under stress scenarios.

I apply Machine Learning and Deep Learning to the 4 pillars of Risk:


Market Risk: Advanced metrics (VaR/ES), GARCH family models, t-Copulas, and Extreme Value Theory (EVT).


Credit Risk: ML-based PD prediction, granular portfolio segmentation, and monotonic constraints.


Liquidity Risk: Predictive cash flow modeling and dynamic stress testing.


Operational Risk: Anomaly detection algorithms and model auditing.

Technical Stack:

Programming: Advanced Python (NumPy, Pandas, Numba, Scikit-learn, PySpark), SQL, Git.


Quant & ML: Econometrics, Causal Inference, Time-Series (LSTM/Transformers), Bayesian Inference, Differential Evolution.


Infrastructure & BI: MLOps (Docker, AWS), Streamlit, Power BI (DAX).

I thrive in high-stakes environments where programming and modeling are the primary tools for risk mitigation. Committed to continuous learning and the evolution of quantitative finance.
